# Mutual-Exclusion
Well, a repository on a small project

Hi. Viicode here. Doing my almost first project here on github.
Let's start...

This project illustrates the use of semaphores to write programs that allows two processes to share a resource (printer). A process currently using the resource cannot be interrupted by the other process untill it is done with the resource and subsequently releases it. This is simply known as the mutual exclusion technique in concurrent programming under the study of operating systems.
